    "background": "I'm a recent college graduate (Psychology) who loves dogs. I grew up with several family dogs and always loved playing with them and hiking, jogging, swimming. I started this service because there are many busy people near me who may not have the time to walk their dog every day. Walking a dog enriches them and keeps happy and calm so when my clients (owners) arrive home they know the dog is happy and not anxious. I am also considering offering dog training so I want to see if there is enough interest.",
    "goals": "I want to find clients that live nearby and have well-behaved dogs to be walked several times per week. If a dog gets along well with other dogs then I can walk several at once which is best for profit. I can take a dog that has some health issues if the conditions are not serious: I'm not a veterinarian. I won't accept dogs that are not vaccinated, bred to be aggressive, or are known to bite people. I would like to learn a bit about the client's expectations and preferences through the questions."
