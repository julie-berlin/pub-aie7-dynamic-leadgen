# Dynamic Lead Gen with Agents - Project Context

## Project Overview
This application helps client users create multi-step forms for lead generation with two key AI-powered capabilities:
1. **Adaptive Question Selection**: Questions are ordered and selected based on user responses
2. **Lead Qualification**: Automated assessment of whether answers indicate a qualified lead

The system uses AI agents to create intelligent, engaging forms that maximize conversion and lead quality.

## Application Architecture

### Core Capabilities
1. **Form Creation**: Marketers set up lead gen forms (initially manual config, later agent-assisted)
2. **Adaptive Forms**: Public-facing multi-step forms with AI-driven question flow
3. **Lead Scoring & Messaging**: Automated lead qualification with personalized responses
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Daily insights and strategy recommendations for marketers

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+ with LangChain & LangGraph
- **Session Management**: Starlette SessionMiddleware with Redis backend (OWASP-compliant HTTP-only cookies)
- **Database**: Supabase for data storage and real-time updates
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS v4 for theming
- **Package Manager**: uv (modern Python package manager)
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration management

## LangGraph Flow Architecture (Simplified)

### Simplified Flow Design
**RECENTLY SIMPLIFIED**: All child nodes have been consolidated into their parent supervisors for better performance and maintainability.

### Available Test Forms
Ready-to-use form IDs for testing:
- `f1111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` - Pawsome Dog Walking
- `f2222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222` - Metro Realty Group
- `f3333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333` - TechSolve Consulting

## Business Rules
- Required questions have `required: true` AND scoring rubrics
- Contact info (name, email) only required for qualified leads
- Users must see minimum 4 questions before failure (unless hard fail)
- Tough qualifying questions should not appear early in flow
- Form abandonment data must be tracked and analyzed

## Development Notes
- Use `python3` in all commands
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Database-first approach: All questions and client data stored in Supabase
- Configuration is centralized in `/config/` directory
- All LLM interactions should be mockable for testing
- Design for future multilingual support
- Tailwind v4 configuration required for theming

## Session Management Architecture

### Security Implementation
- **HTTP-only Cookies**: Session data never exposed to client-side JavaScript
- **OWASP Compliance**: Follows security best practices for session management
- **Redis Backend**: Sessions stored in Redis with automatic TTL (30 minutes)
- **Middleware Integration**: Starlette SessionMiddleware with custom Redis store
- **Scoped Cookies**: Session cookies limited to `/api/survey` path
- **Environment-specific HTTPS**: HTTPS-only cookies in production

### Session Files
- **`session_manager.py`**: Starlette SessionMiddleware integration helpers
- **`session_store.py`**: Custom Redis session store implementing Starlette interface
- **`main.py`**: SessionMiddleware configuration with Redis backend

## API Testing Examples

All APIs return consistent format: `{"success": boolean, "data": object, "message": text}`

### Start a Survey Session
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/survey/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -c cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "form_id": "f1111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "utm_source": "google",
    "utm_campaign": "dog_walking_test"
  }'
```

### Submit Responses (using session cookie)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/survey/step \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "responses": [
      {
        "question_id": 1,
        "answer": "John Smith"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Check Session Status
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/survey/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### Mark Session as Abandoned
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/survey/abandon \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### Validate Form Availability
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/survey/forms/f1111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/validate
```

## Recent Implementation Updates (Aug 2025)

### Session Management Migration
**Migration from fastapi-sessions to Starlette SessionMiddleware:**
- **Reason**: fastapi-sessions had import issues and didn't include Redis backend out of the box
- **Solution**: Implemented Starlette's built-in SessionMiddleware with custom Redis store
- **Result**: More stable, better integrated, simpler codebase

**Key Changes Made:**
1. Created `RedisSessionStore` class implementing Starlette session interface
2. Updated `session_manager.py` to use `request.session` directly
3. Modified all API endpoints to use session cookies instead of explicit session IDs
4. Fixed `abandon` endpoint to properly load `form_id` from database like other endpoints
5. Added comprehensive middleware stack in correct order for security

**API Consistency Improvements:**
- All endpoints now return consistent `{"success": boolean, "data": object, "message": text}` format
- Created `response_helpers.py` with standardized response functions
- Added response sanitization middleware with timestamps and sanitization markers
- Improved error handling with proper HTTP status codes

**Security Enhancements:**
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks on session data
- Session cookies scoped to `/api/survey` path only
- Environment-specific HTTPS enforcement
- 30-minute session timeout with Redis TTL
- Comprehensive middleware stack: security headers, rate limiting, input validation, response sanitization

**Docker Environment Improvements:**
- Full containerization with backend, frontend, and Redis services
- Working Docker Compose setup with proper networking
- Environment-specific configuration with development vs production settings

### Testing Strategy
- Test flow with different lead quality scenarios
- Validate scoring logic against business requirements
- Test abandonment prevention and re-engagement
- Verify database state consistency
- Test real-time vs batch notification systems
- **New**: End-to-end session management testing with cookie persistence
- **New**: API consistency validation across all endpoints
- **New**: Security middleware integration testing
