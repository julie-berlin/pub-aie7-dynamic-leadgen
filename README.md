## ‚úÖ Problem Worth Solving

Businesses spend time customizing multi-step forms and still fail to capture quality leads. Most lead gen funnels are static, hard to personalize, and high-friction. Users either abandon them mid-way or provide low-quality responses.

One traditional way of capturing leads for your business is a lead generation form. Often this is a multi-step form where the prospect answers a series of questions. The answers they provide are used to help qualify them. These "funnels" are difficult to get right and often marketers must make multiple, customized versions to suit each audience and keep them engaged.

What if we leveraged the power of LLMs to vary the questions according to the type of visitor and their answers? We used an LLM to score the lead along the way and ask more questions if the user stays engaged. All of this information is then combined to personalize their messages.

## üß† Potential LLM Solution

An LLM-powered form agent that:

- Conversationally adapts to user responses in real time
- Chooses the most relevant next question(s) from a marketer-defined set
- Rephrases and styles questions to suit the user's tone and personality
- Applies persuasion techniques to reduce abandonment and increase truthfulness
- Scores responses against a rubric to qualify leads
- Auto-generates personalized responses, final-page CTAs, and follow-up emails
- Helps the business design the form funnel from scratch, using branding and service info

## üéØ Target Audience

- Small to medium businesses (SMBs)
- Solo marketers or growth hackers
- Agencies that build web funnels for clients

## üìè Key Metrics

- Form completion rate
- Lead quality score (as judged by conversion or post-funnel behavior)
- Time to create a working funnel
- Follow-up email open and reply rate

## üìö Data Sources for RAG and Fine-Tuning

- Background info from the business (e.g. service details, tone, offers)
- Query parameters from the incoming request provides information about the source and campaign
- Question set + required flags + qualification rubric (provided by marketer)
- Conversational UX patterns from high-converting chatbot scripts (could be used to fine-tune)
- Optionally, pre-built industry-specific funnel templates to bootstrap marketers
