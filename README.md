## ‚úÖ Problem Worth Solving

Businesses spend time customizing multi-step forms and still fail to capture quality leads. Most lead gen funnels are static, hard to personalize, and high-friction. Users either abandon them mid-way or provide low-quality responses.

One traditional way of capturing leads for your business is a lead generation form. Often this is a multi-step form where the prospect answers a series of questions. The answers they provide are used to help qualify them. These "funnels" are difficult to get right and often marketers must make multiple, customized versions to suit each audience and keep them engaged.

What if we leveraged the power of LLMs to vary the questions according to the type of visitor and their answers? We used an LLM to score the lead along the way and ask more questions if the user stays engaged. All of this information is then combined to personalize their messages.
